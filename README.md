# Project Breakdown

### Hardware interface:
Figuring out how to interface with the raspberry pi gpio pins to control the rc car

### Network interface:
Figuring out how to connect to the raspberry pi (wifi or bluetooth) and send the commands to control the rc car

### Control interface:
Figuring out how to glue both the network interface and the hardware interface together efficiently
